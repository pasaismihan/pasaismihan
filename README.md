Hello everyone 👋🏻 , I am Pasa

<hr width="850"/>

I finished among the top 10 students at Workintech educational institution, outperforming 1200 candidates, by successfully completing 45 frontend and 22 backend projects. Throughout my software journey, I diligently determined, built, and tested project requirements, adhering to the Agile development model. I effectively resolved issues encountered during project development and actively contributed to group management and collaboration. Looking ahead, my ambition is to leverage my project development skills and the team training I have received to make a meaningful impact in a professional setting. By doing so, I aim to continuously enhance my own abilities while driving growth for the company.![image](https://github.com/pasaismihan/pasaismihan/assets/119595276/acaf5054-e3cc-4625-943b-b7c512b1f8d0)
